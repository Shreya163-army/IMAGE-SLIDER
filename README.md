# Image Slider Project

This project is a responsive and interactive image slider built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes features like automatic sliding, navigation buttons, pagination dots, keyboard navigation, swipe gestures, and customizable transition speed.

## Features

- **Automatic Sliding**: The slider automatically transitions between images at a customizable interval.
- **Navigation Buttons**: Users can navigate to the previous or next image using buttons.
- **Pagination Dots**: Dots below the slider indicate the current image and allow users to jump to a specific image.
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Use the left and right arrow keys to navigate through the images.
- **Swipe Gestures**: Swipe left or right on touch devices to navigate between images.
- **Custom Transition Speed**: Adjust the transition speed using an input field.
- **Loop Toggle**: Enable or disable looping of the slider.
- **Responsive Design**: The slider adjusts to different screen sizes for a seamless experience on all devices.

## File Structure

- `IMAGE SLIDER.HTML`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the slider.
- `slider.css`: The CSS file for styling the slider.
- `slider.js`: The JavaScript file for implementing slider functionality.
- **Images**: The folder contains the images used in the slider (e.g., `whiskey 1.jpg`, `vodka4.jpg`).

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `IMAGE SLIDER.HTML` file in a web browser.
3. Use the navigation buttons, pagination dots, or keyboard arrows to navigate through the images.
4. Adjust the transition speed using the input field.
5. Toggle the loop functionality using the "Disable Loop" button.

## Customization

- **Images**: Replace the existing images in the `slides` container with your own images.
- **Transition Speed**: Change the default transition speed by modifying the `transitionSpeed` variable in `slider.js`.
- **Styling**: Customize the appearance of the slider by editing the `slider.css` file.
